# Sign2Text-Vision-Transformer-Powered-Video-Processing-
Sign Language requires a video modality data to be processed for better accuracy, hence we propose Vision Transformer based Video Processing method. Where each frame of a video is treated as a patch of a 1 big image, kinda like "A frame of a Video is worth 128*128 word" 😁😂, thus allowing parallel processing of frames in a video.
